					Good afternoon! <br /> <br /> We don't advertise as much, and every
					time we have a significant number of new people come in, we do a
					little post introduction.
					<br /> <br />
					In a post like this, we'll try to answer the MOST frequent questions
					we've been getting for almost three years now. Don't restaurant. We
					have seating, but it's shared, but the market is cool come on over!
					<br /> <br />
					We have a wood stove.
					<br /> <br />
					Yes on real firewood, we buy them dry (but sometimes there are slugs),
					they are made of birch, it's important! üßê
					<br />
					<br />
					Leopard crust-not burned, it has to be, the pizza is cooked on an open
					fire(that's important too, not on coals) and it's burnt carbon
					pockets.

					We don't have thin or thick dough, we're making Neapolitan pizza,
					which is a puffy rim and a thin, thin crust in the middle, with very
					juicy toppings, because the pizza doesn't sit in the oven for more
					than two minutes and doesn't have time to dry out.

					Our pizzas may not be perfectly round, it's handmade, and live dough,
					and things can go wrong with a perfect scenario, we cook without
					crutches, and we care about the taste and not the look. That doesn't
					mean, of course, that you're necessarily going to get obscure squares,
					we're just trying to to cook more traditionally, without getting hung
					up on commercial standards of beauty.
					<br />
					<br /> We love our business, our product, and we know everything about
					it. We We're always looking for the best tasting products, and we try

					easy. For us, the most important thing is to introduce you, to our
					food. We can tell you about it absolutely everything, you can always
					ask a question, or stop by the pizzeria for a chat.

					If your question is urgent call us by phone. The phone is always open
					from 11 till 21.

					We don't have any discounts, we have great prices, we consider them a
					little low ourselves. Discounts devalue the process, and at the end of
					the day, if we're only chosen based on the presence or absence of
					discounts, it's probably they're not our customers.
